# School_District_Analysis-M4
## Purpose
* Maria has suspicion that therre has been academic dishonesty in the school district. She gave us an assignment to run the same school district analysis for her districts.
# Results
## After cleaning the data we noticed that there was a small group of students that had no grade which was affecting the accurracy of the data. How we fixed it was taking the no grades student of the total amount of students to get are total

## We noticed that Rodriguez, Figueroa, Huang, Hernandez, and Johnson High school all have the lowest score but why is that, Out of these 5 schools one common thing they all had together was there school size. Noticing this we looked into the average reading and math scores for school sizes.

## Schools with a large school size had a drastically lower average than the rest of the school
# Summary
## From the data and testing we collected we can see that the schools with the largest student body had the lowest average scrores Seeing this we can assume the following issues: 
1) Since there is alot of students alot of the students are getting the propper attention they need to be successful
2) If all students arent getting the attention the need we could assume there is a staffing issues. Theres not enough teachers for each student to get the required attention they need to be successful.
3) Another thing we can assume is money being mismanaged. From the data we saw that the largest schools have way more money than the medium schools. The question is where is all that money going. I know with more students you need more money to take care of them but with the budget the big schools are getting they should be able to provide the best for there students so the question is why are they not?
